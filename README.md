- 👋 Hi, I am Usman Tariq.
- 👀 I’m interested in designing deep learning architectures for learning multimodal similarity in bioinformatics, image/caption matching, and fMRI data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to implement and customize attention networks for domain specific requirement e.g. for hypersparse extremely large vectors.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to solving challenging problems using ML/DL.
- 📫 You can reach me at mtari008@fiu.edu
